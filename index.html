							<p>Triptych: Journey Through Cancer is a project that I was proud to volunteer on. It is a triptych (trio) of related art films created by oncology nurse and dancer Jennifer Faust to express and support her experiences of watching patients and their families/friends battle against cancer.</p>
							
							<p>All profits from the film are donated to cancer research organizations. With the help of the project manager/graphic designer, I created the WordPress theme that this site uses by writing the HTML and CSS that is used. I also placed all the content in the site that you can see except the addition of the second film, which came out much later.</p>

						<h1>How is your website working for you?</h1>
					</header>
					<section>
						
						<p>If you have your own business, you NEED a website to allow your potential customers to learn about your services or products easily. Many small businesses have focused on utilizing social media or Yelp! as their home on the internet.</p>
						
						<p>Unfortunately, it has happened too many times that a social media site closes down (do you still remember Vine? or MySpace?) or your information is only accessible to registered users of that site - or perhaps a customer doesn't want to use a particular social media site (see Faceboo, Instagram, Mastodon, etc.), so for ease and comfort, they move on to the next company instead - and you've just lost a customer.</p>

						<h1>Are you outdated?</h1>

						<p>Do you have a website that was built 20 years ago? 10 years ago? 5 years ago? Technology advances quickly and trends are temporary and can make customers see your company as outdated, out of touch, or just plain stale. They may even get the impression that your company is closing or closed - that your website is obviously too old for a company that is still thriving and reliable.</p>

						<p>It pays to update your website on a regular basis and to make sure it is usable and accessible. It should never only be available on a computer - it needs to be easy to use and usable on smartphones as tablets as well (according to <a href = "https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/" target="_blank">Statista.com</a>, ). No one wants to scroll side-to-side or have to pinch-zoom to read your text. I can create a website for you that looks beautiful regardless of how your customers are accesssing it, including accessible devices like screen readers (I am absolutely PASSIONATE about accessibility).</p>
